- Windows only at the moment, support for other platforms will be added once this project is fully functional on Windows
- we only compile and provide executables for 64-bit. if you need a 32-bit executable please compile the project yourself (Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition is recommended as it is our main development version)

Note: this software does NOT replace Steam or any other launcher. It merely serves as a unified list for all your games so that you do not have to run every launcher yourself. Just start a game from this list and it will load the appropriate launcher for you.
