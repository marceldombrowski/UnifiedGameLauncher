Don't you hate launching Steam, Origin, Battle.net, Gog Galaxy, uPlay, and all the other services just to figure out what you want to play?

With this app you can add all games from all launchers into a unified list. No more digging through several apps to find what you want to play. Just dig through this list :)

Please check the wiki at https://github.com/marceldombrowski/UnifiedGameLauncher/wiki for further information
