# Welcome to the Unified Game Launcher YES (UGLY) Wiki!

_Note: this is only the internal name right now, it might change depending on whether we can come up with a better name_

Thanks for taking the time to read through this page. It is a hobby project (meaning we do not get paid for it and we are not endorsed by anybody for creating it) and we are developing it in our spare time.

## About

Don't you hate launching Steam, Origin, Battle.net, Gog Galaxy, uPlay, and all the other services just to figure out what you want to play?

With this app you can add all games from all launchers into a unified list. No more digging through several apps to find what you want to play. Just dig through this list :)

This program is free of charge and open source as we do believe in open source software. This program will never spy on you. Everything you do is only saved locally. 

We might add support for accounts later on if this is a feature that we find useful and if this feature is requested. If this will happen, your list of games will be stored encrypted online. No information will be shared with third parties.

## Helping

If you want to help, please feel free to fork this project and implement your own ideas. You can then ask to merge your changes with this project at which point I will review them and update the main branch accordingly. You will then also be added to the list of contributors.


## Todo

- Importing from steam should be better. need a routine to parse the appinfo.vdf file as it contains all the necessary information
- The app does not have a routine to handle apps with the same executable filenames
- Importing from other launchers is still missing
- Auto-update would be nice
- Discord integration for chat, voice chat and user interaction
