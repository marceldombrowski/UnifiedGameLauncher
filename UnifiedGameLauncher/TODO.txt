TODO
- importing from steam should be better. need a routine to parse the appinfo.vdf file as it contains all the necessary information
- editing game info is still missing
- the app does not have a routine to handle apps with the same executable filenames
- importing from other launchers is still missing
- auto-update would be nice
- discord integration
